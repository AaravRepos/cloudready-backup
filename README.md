Install & Setup
You can run CloudReady directly from USB or install it on your certified device with the CloudReady USB installer that you created in the previous step.

Important: Full installation is optional. If you choose to install, CloudReady overwrites all data on your hard drive. We recommend that you have an up-to-date backup of your data before you install CloudReady.

Step 1: Boot & Install
 
With your device turned off, plug in the USB installer. 
Turn on your device while you repeatedly press the boot key. A menu with boot options opens. 
Tip: Find the most common models and their boot keystroke.
From the menu, select your USB installer.
Tip: Your USB installer shows as “USB device,” “USB storage,” or a name that matches the brand of the USB drive manufacturer.   
After CloudReady starts, a “Welcome!” screen opens.
From the “Welcome!” screen, select Let’s go. 
Important: If you don’t want to install CloudReady on your device’s internal storage, skip to step 2.3 below to run from USB.
At the bottom right, select the time and then Install OS.
From the prompt, select Install CloudReady. 
Follow the on-screen instructions to Erase hard drive & install CloudReady. When the install is finished, let your device automatically turn off. 
Tip: This process can take up to 20 minutes to complete. 
Step 2: Setup
 
With your device turned off, take out the USB installer.
Tip: Before you remove the USB installer, use the keyboard or touchpad to check if your device is fully turned off. 
Turn on your device. 
From the “Welcome!” screen, select Let’s go.
